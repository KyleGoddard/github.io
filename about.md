In 2010 I joined [Fluid Media](http://fluidmedia.ca) where I learned that my favourite part of the job is programming for mobile and specifically for `iOS`.

At Fluid Media I've had the chance to explore many technologies including `Ruby on Rails`, `Android Development`, `Swift`, `Objective-C`, `JavaScript` and many others.

In my spare time when not hanging out with my family, I'm usually programming. I appreciate the challenges that programming provides, and the mental exercise it takes to keep learning more everyday.
